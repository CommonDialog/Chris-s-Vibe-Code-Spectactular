You will find the same basic roguelike implemented in both Claude and Gemini.

Claude's implementation tends to produce multiple versions for each prompt, therefore instead of showing how the code changed after each prompt, the Claude - Prompts.txt file shows all the prompts that lead to the final product.  You can upload it to Claude or run it as you would any React file.

The other Gemini - ThreePrompts.txt was actually my first implementation of Gemini and shows the three prompts I got to enter before I ran out of free credits. :)

I'm not saying that my prompting style is the correct way to do it, but I tend to converse with my AIs and arrive at a goal rather than form one giant prompt.  Also, it should be noted that I produced the Claude files second so the prompt reflects functionality missed initially in Gemini.  It also shows me hitting the Enter key too early which is why the first prompt is formatted so weird.
