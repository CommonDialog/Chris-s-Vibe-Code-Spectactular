A place where I store small projects that I vibe coded

<b>Roguelike</b> is a comparison between Gemini and Claude for creating a simple roguelike clone like I played in the past.  It shows my initial prompt and several follow on prompts.  For Gemini (which used the free version of 2.5 Pro), the resulting file is provided after each prompt.  For Claude, I used Sonnet 4 and provided the results after several prompts.  Claude was prompted second and you can see how I started to change the prompting after Gemini.
