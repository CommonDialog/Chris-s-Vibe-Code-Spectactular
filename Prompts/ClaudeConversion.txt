I would like you to convert Original.js to a well formatted React project.  Please perserve the functionality exactly.

When converting one file to another, use these steps:

# Before converting, create a checklist:
- Goal type icons (Money, Weight, Exercise, Travel)
- Checkbox grids for weekly steps â‰¤10 targets
- +/- buttons with input fields for numeric steps
- Rich add-step form with type selection
- Sophisticated progress bars for each step
- etc...

// Instead of rewriting, extract exact sections:
// 1. Find the original function/component
// 2. Copy it exactly
// 3. Only change imports and prop passing
// 4. Test each feature works identically

// WRONG: "Let me simplify this complex logic"
const calculateProgress = () => {
  // Basic calculation
}

// RIGHT: "Let me preserve this complex logic exactly"
const calculateOverallProgress = () => {
  // Exact copy of original complex calculation
  if (!goal.steps || goal.steps.length === 0) {
    // Fallback to original goal progress if no steps
    if (goal.type === 'temperature') {
      return (goal.current / goal.target) * 100;
    }
    // ... exact original logic
  }
}

# After conversion, verify:
1. Every button in original exists in new version
2. Every interaction works identically  
3. Every visual element is preserved
4. Every piece of state is maintained
5. All edge cases handle the same way

// Instead of:
// 1. Create new simple component
// 2. Add basic features
// 3. Try to remember what was missing

// Do:
// 1. Copy exact original component code
// 2. Extract to new file with minimal changes
// 3. Update only imports and prop drilling
// 4. Test feature-by-feature against original
